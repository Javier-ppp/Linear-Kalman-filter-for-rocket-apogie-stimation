# Linear-Kalman-filter-for-rocket-apogie-stimation

For the Experimental data processing course final project, I led a team to use the Kalman filter and forward-backward exponential smoothing technique to stimate the apogie of a rocket based on noisy data. The Filter was built from scratch without using any off-the-shelf librery.
